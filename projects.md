## Current Projects
### Necromass contributions to soil organic matter.

- I am currently a postdoc with [Kristen DeAngelis](https://kristendeangelis.net/) at UMass Amherst, where I am conducting experiments to assess how microbes contribute to the formation and persistence of soil organic matter through their iterative processes of growth, death, and recycling of cell constituents (necromass).

## Previous Projects
### Soil carbon cycling in dynamic floodplain systems.

- Soils are a vast reservoir of global carbon, containing more carbon than the atmosphere and plants combined. However, because we donâ€™t know what keeps carbon in the soil, we cannot predict how soil carbon will respond to climate change. My dissertation research at UMass Amherst explored an ecosystem heavily impacted by climate change: alpine watersheds. Specifically, I investigated how snowmelt and associated flooding events at the East River in Colorado impact carbon dynamics in floodplain soils, through interactions with both minerals and microbes. To do this research, I worked with Marco Keiluweit's Soil Biogeochemistry Group (now at [UNIL](https://wp.unil.ch/bgc/)) and a team of researchers involved with the Watershed Function project at the East River floodplain in Colorado, located near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. 
- Understanding how carbon cycles in dynamic floodplain environments will improve our ability to predict the fate of soil carbon in response to climate change, especially as extreme floods and droughts become ever more common.

### Spatial controls on soil carbon cycling in high-latitude permafrost ecosystems.

- As a Research Associate at the Pacific Northwest National Lab, I worked with James Stegen and a team of researchers to investigate soil carbon cycling in high latitude systems impacted by permafrost (permanently frozen soil). Specifically, we addressed how soil carbon cycling and associated microbial communities are spatially structured in these ecosystems, and how that structure changes as permafrost thaws. We used field, lab, and modeling techniques to explore these relationships.

- Our field site for this work was the [Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW)](http://www.lter.uaf.edu/research/study-sites-cpcrw), just north of Fairbanks, Alaska, and part of the Bonanza Creek LTER. CPCRW and Bonanza Creek maintain an open database of field data.

## Effects of biosolids and biochar amendments on agricultural soil

- I completed my MS in Soils and Biogeochemistry at UC Davis. As part of Kate Scow's soil microbial ecology lab, I studied how waste products such as biosolids and biochar can be used as amendments to agricultural soil. A major question I asked was how chemicals commonly found in biosolids (antibiotics and other personal care products, for example) can affect soil microbial communities and related processes, and if biochar can be used to remediate contaminated biosolids.
