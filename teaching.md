<em>"We hold so many worlds inside us. So many futures. It is our radical responsibility to share these worlds, to plant them in the soil of our society as seeds for the type of justice we want and need."</em><br>

Telling stories and imagining futures is a powerful way to vision and build the just futures that sustain rather than extract, care rather than exploit. In my teaching and mentorship, I strive to create spaces to experience soil, story our connections to the environment and climate change, and connect and empower students to think together as scientists.

Through my own meandering journey to soil science I have found agility in crossing disciplines and techniques to lead and facilitate soils teaching moments, whether in the field, lab, or classroom.

Courses previously taught:
* Introduction to Soil Science (University of California Davis, University of Massachusetts Amherst)
* Beyond Earth: Sci Fi and Otherworldly Soils (University of Massachusetts Amherst)
* Diversity / Inclusion / Pedagogy Seminar (University of Massachusetts Amherst) (https://websites.umass.edu/geosci595p-fbowlick/about/)
* "From the Ground Up" soils hike with the Kestrel Land Trust (co-organized with M. Garcia-Arredondo, R. Davenport)
* "Soils & Climate Change" soils field trip with Arcadia Wildlife Sanctuary (co-organized with M. Shinfuku, M. Garcia-Arredondo)
